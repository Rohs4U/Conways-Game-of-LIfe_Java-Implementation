Conways-Game-of-LIfe_Java-Implementation
========================================

A(nother) Java implementation of Conways Game of LIfe

Conways Game of Life has always been interesting to me. I like the sort of plague-esque nature of it. It seemed like a fun first project as I'm in the process of learning Java and git.

It starts basic: time step manipulation, individual step, random grid. I would like to expand it and turn the grid into a more generic mosaic class, separate out the game logic from the mosaic, and then add more bells and whistles such as colors, changing the game size, zooming, and the ability to edit the game board.
